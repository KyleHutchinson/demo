# demo
A demo project from Kids Can Code
'''
Curious, Creative, Tenacious(requires hopefulness)

**********Gameplay ideas:
Jump on enemy head to create jump boost using power up code
Randomize jump sound
Add fake platforms that don't allow you to land on them.
Add a cactus that will kill the player if he collides with it
Change the mobs from the flying machines to the female bunny


**********Bugs
when you get launched by powerup or head jump player sometimes snaps to platform abruptly 
happens when hitting jump during power up boostd
Sometimes the real platforms get hidden behind the fake platforms so you can't actually tell if there is a platform there or not.

**********Gameplay fixes
Platform randomness leaves player in limbo for extended periods
Lower spawn location so player can get out of random stuck situations

**********Features
Powerup that lets you jump higher when you collide with the powerup
Fake platforms that don't allow you to actually land on them
